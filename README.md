This website serves several purposes:
  To outline a fictional world of Ryan's creation, the plan of Mag Ildathach.
  To document the party's progress in Ryan's 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons Desert Campaign, set in the Ankhet River city of Dinavar.
  To serve as an ongoing introductory exercise for Ryan's coding journey as he learns HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and more! Could this be a valid career path?
